Description: Converts alpha hull objects (`alphahull`) into Spatial* objects for use with the
    `sp` package. It allows arcs to be converted into line segments, which can then
    be used to create SpatialLines and SpatialPolygons objects. This process allows 
    alpha hulls to be used in mapping processes in R.
